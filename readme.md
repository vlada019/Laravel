## Project based on:

* Laravel 5.7

## development hints:

* primary keys should always be named as id
* think twice about entity relations
* pointers on how to design an entity schema and create proper entity attributes. for more info click [here](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/migrations)
* always use english for all sort of names [ types, variables, classes .. ]
* you can autocreate created_at and updated_at columns; check above link as well

## base entities:

* user -> id, name, email, verified, password, token, created, updated // loggedin users | used for application access
* role -> id, name, created, updated // different levels of application access [ regular, anon, manager, admin, client .. ]
* client -> id, name, email, phone, address, logo[fileId], created, updated // actual client on the project // so you can filter projects per client
* employee -> id, userType[ actor, model, kid, extra, whatever ], name, gender, birthYear, height, weight, size, shoeSize, phone, university, agency, country, city, specSkill, blackList, email, specSkill, country, city, address, job, mostUsedExtras // suggest better entity name that will cover all types of users in the databse ? | add more attributes ?
* project -> id, name, clientId, shootingDate, finished, created, updated
* engagements -> projectId, userType, userId // userType = [ model, actor, extra .. ], userId -> [modelId, actorId ] // many to many, single table to keep track of project engagements for all types of users and all projects
* file -> id, extension, mimeType, size, path
* media -> userId, userType, fileId // many-to-many between files and users [ actor, model, kid .. ]
* note -> id, name, done, employeeId, projectId // to which entity we related the note to ? employee or project ? remove the unnecessary one
* session -> sessionId, expired


[] Complete the list according to user table analogy, add missing attributes as well as missing entities
[] Once above is checked we move to adding migration classes


## Standards and pointers:

* classes should not be longer than 300 LOC
* methods should not be longer than 30 LOC
* all architecture needs to be fully decoupled
* Stick to DRY principles by any means
* commit your code as often as possible
* push your code at least once a day
* if you get stuck for >4h by not being able to solve a problem, ping TL => do not waste time!
* base your implemention on design patterns => do not reinvent the wheel poorly
* HAVE FUN :)

## Development workflow [ this is to be followed later | disregard for now ]:

* all features/issues are done in a seprate branch branched off of develop branch
* name your branches the same as teamwork tasks
* always branch off of develop branch
* no direct commits in develop/master branch
* after you push your branch, request a code reivew in beanstalk and your branch will be merged by TL
* if you need to merge the code in development branch asap so you can continue working, ping the TL
